> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computing that develops systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. This includes learning, reasoning, perception, pattern recognition, and decision-making. It uses algorithms and mathematical models to analyze data and learn from it. Some of the main techniques include:

* Machine Learning (ML) = Algorithms that perform skills through training, without being explicitly programmed, identifying patterns and making decisions based on data.
* Neural Networks (NM) = Models inspired by the functioning of neurons in the human brain, that is, a set of interconnected neurons
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) = Allows machines to understand and generate humanized language.

#### Types of Learning
- Supervised = In supervised learning, the model is trained with data that already has the associated responses (labels). In other words, you provide the model with input examples and the respective desired outputs
- Unsupervised = The model works with data that does not have labels. The goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures (classification) within the data without knowing in advance what the correct outputs are, that is, "no output"
- Reinforcement learning = In reinforcement learning, the model learns by trial and error, that is, it makes decisions in a dynamic environment, and learns from the feedback it receives, indicating errors, but not providing solutions

#### Use of Models
- Image recognition
- Pattern classification
- Clustering
- Prediction
- Optimization
- Approximations

### Artificial Neuron

> Neural network models use an artificial neuron, which functions in a similar way to biological neurons. The first step is the input signals, which are the data received by the neuron, which can be numerical values ​​that represent characteristics or variables of a problem. Then, each input is multiplied by a weight, which is an adjustable value, determining the importance of each input. After the inputs are multiplied by the weights, they are added together, generating a result. This result will be applied to an activation function (which can be linear, sigmoid, ReLU, among others), which decides whether the neuron will be activated (generating an output/response) or not.
